# Koi Documentation Style Guide

## Purpose  
Welcome to the Koi Documentation Style Guide!
This guide helps keep our docs clear, accurate, and easy to navigate for investors, innovators, and developers.  

Our customers tend to be **experts in their fields**, but they **may not be specialists in impact forecasting**.
We don‚Äôt assume prior knowledge, and we always link to helpful resources when needed.  

Our perspective:
- Our climate is changing and we need everyone, including the world's capital, to support the brilliant and motivated minds of climate innovators.
  - Unfortunately, assaults on basic logic and decency compels us to state this plainly.
- Solutions are wide ranging across mitigation, adaptation, and both technical and process-oriented innovations.
- All forecasts are a guess. We focus on consistency in applying methodologies and transparency in our processes and assumptions.
- We will constantly strive to state objective facts, correct ourselves when we're wrong, and learn from the wonderful world of collaborators out there!
- üêü And hey, if we can work in the occasional fish pun without muddying the waters, why not?

## Writing Principles  

### 1. Keep It Flowing (Clarity & Conciseness)  
- Focus on clarity and conciseness.  
- Avoid jargon unless it‚Äôs essential‚Äîwhen in doubt, define it or link to a resource.  
- Try to use visual examples to illustrate key points without over-explaining.  

### 2. Precision Matters (Capitalization, Units & Accuracy)  
- **Units & Capitalization:**  
  - There's a big difference between **Mt** and **mt**, for example. Pay attention to the little details including capitalization.
- **Acronyms:**  
  - Spell out on first use, then stick to the acronym.  
  - Example: *Tonnes of Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (tCO‚ÇÇe) is a standard unit of measurement for comparing the climate impact of different greenhouse gases. tCO‚ÇÇe are...*  
- **Say what‚Äôs real, skip what‚Äôs vague.**  
  - Instead of ‚Äúsignificant emissions reductions,‚Äù say **‚Äúa 40% reduction in CO‚ÇÇ emissions over 10 years.‚Äù**  

### 3. No Talking Down, No Talking Over  
- Assume your audience is intelligent and eager to learn. They are likely to not be experts in **this**, so help them out.
- Use an approachable, professional tone‚Äîlike explaining something to a colleague over coffee.

## Formatting & Style  

### Headings & Capitalization  
- Use **Capital Case**:  
  - ‚úÖ *Avoided Emissions Methodology*  
  - ‚ùå *Avoided emissions methodology*  

### Numbers & Units  
- Use numerals (5% instead of five percent).  
- Always include units when discussing data (**500 MtCO‚ÇÇe**, not *500*).  

### Links & References  
- Always provide links instead of assuming readers know a concept.  
- Example: *For more on the GHG Protocol, see [this guide](https://ghgprotocol.org/).*  

### Code & Formatting  
- Inline code snippets: `` `backticks` ``  
- Multi-line code blocks:  
  ```python  
  sample_code_here()  
  ```

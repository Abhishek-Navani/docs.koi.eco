# RESTful API

Integrate our robust climate forecasting engine into your workflows with a developer-friendly interface.

<Note>
  Before you can make requests to the Koi API, you will need to grab your
  API key from your dashboard. You find it under [Settings &raquo; API](#).
</Note>

## Choose your client

Before making your first API request, you need to pick which API client you will use. In addition to good ol' cURL HTTP requests, Koi offers clients for JavaScript, Python, and PHP. In the following example, you can see how to install each client.

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
# cURL is most likely already installed on your machine
curl --version
```

```bash {{ language: 'js' }}
# Install the Koi JavaScript SDK
npm install @koi/koi-api --save
```

```bash {{ language: 'python' }}
# Install the Koi Python SDK
pip install koi_api
```

</CodeGroup>

  <Button href="/sdks" variant="text" arrow="right">
    <>Check out our list of first-party SDKs</>
  </Button>
</div>

## Making your first API request

After picking your preferred client, you are ready to make your first call to the Koi API.
Below, you can see how to send a GET request to the Models endpoint to get a list of all your models.
In the cURL example, results are limited to ten models, the default page length for each client.

<CodeGroup tag="GET" label="/v1/models">

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
curl -G https://api.koi.eco/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -d limit=10
```

```js
import ApiClient from '@koi/koi-api'

const client = new ApiClient(token)

await client.models.list()
```

```python
from koi_api import ApiClient

client = ApiClient(token)

client.models.list()
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button href="/models" variant="text" arrow="right">
    <>Read the docs for the Models endpoint</>
  </Button>
</div>
